# CNN-CIFAR10

 During winter break between fall 2020 and spring 2021, I implemented a convolutional neural network on the CIFAR 10 dataset in Python. I used the PyTorch machine learning library to implement it. I also made a powerpoint (converted to pdf format) on convolutional neural networks to demonstrate my understanding of convolutional neural networks.
